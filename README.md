See [What this fork adds](#-what-this-fork-adds).

## ⚡ Overview

**MiroFish** is a next-generation AI prediction engine powered by multi-agent technology. By extracting seed information from the real world (such as breaking news, policy drafts, or financial signals), it automatically constructs a high-fidelity parallel digital world. Within this space, thousands of intelligent agents with independent personalities, long-term memory, and behavioral logic freely interact and undergo social evolution. You can inject variables dynamically from a "God's-eye view" to precisely deduce future trajectories — **rehearse the future in a digital sandbox, and win decisions after countless simulations**.

> You only need to: Upload seed materials (data analysis reports or interesting novel stories) and describe your prediction requirements in natural language</br>
> MiroFish will return: A detailed prediction report and a deeply interactive high-fidelity digital world

### Our Vision

MiroFish is dedicated to creating a swarm intelligence mirror that maps reality. By capturing the collective emergence triggered by individual interactions, we break through the limitations of traditional prediction:

- **At the Macro Level**: We are a rehearsal laboratory for decision-makers, allowing policies and public relations to be tested at zero risk
- **At the Micro Level**: We are a creative sandbox for individual users — whether deducing novel endings or exploring imaginative scenarios, everything can be fun, playful, and accessible

From serious predictions to playful simulations, we let every "what if" see its outcome, making it possible to predict anything.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Graph Building**: Seed extraction & Individual/collective memory injection & GraphRAG construction
2. **Environment Setup**: Entity relationship extraction & Persona generation & Agent configuration injection
3. **Simulation**: Dual-platform parallel simulation & Auto-parse prediction requirements & Dynamic temporal memory updates
4. **Report Generation**: ReportAgent with rich toolset for deep interaction with post-simulation environment
5. **Deep Interaction**: Chat with any agent in the simulated world & Interact with ReportAgent

## 🍴 What this fork adds

### Jev decision step for agents (optional)

In each round, every active agent normally calls the LLM to pick its action. With `JEV_ENABLED=true`, [Jev](https://openrouter.ai/~typesafe/jev-latest) (TypeSafe's System One model, reached through OpenRouter) makes that decision first. It sees the agent's persona and feed, and returns the action and its target (post, comment or user) with calibrated probabilities.

- **No text needed** (like, dislike, repost, follow, mute, like comment, do nothing): the action runs directly, with no LLM call.
- **Text needed** (create post, comment, quote, search): the LLM is called and told which action Jev chose.
- **Jev error**: that agent falls back to the plain LLM step, so the simulation continues.

By default the action is sampled from Jev's probability distribution rather than taking the top choice, which keeps the population from collapsing into one behavior. Actions still go to the same OASIS database, so logs, reports and the UI work unchanged. The code is in `backend/scripts/jev_decider.py`.

In a 72-round dual-platform run with 47 agents, Jev handled 81% of Twitter decisions and 44% of Reddit decisions without an LLM call, for about US$ 1.17 in Jev usage.

### Stability fixes

- **Simulations now finish.** After the last round, the simulation script stays alive so agents can be interviewed. The runner only marked a run as completed when that process exited, so step 3 never unlocked the report. A run is now completed once every platform ends, and the interview environment stays available.
- **Reopening step 3 no longer wipes a run.** The page used to force-restart the simulation on every mount, which deleted the previous run's databases and logs. It now resumes an existing run and only starts a simulation that never ran or failed.
- **Slow Zep ingestion no longer loses the graph.** The ingestion wait is configurable with `ZEP_INGESTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, default 600s. Retrying a build that timed out reuses the Zep batch when it is still processing or has already succeeded, instead of deleting the graph.
- **Better behavior under Zep's FREE-plan rate limit** (300 requests/minute). HTTP 429 responses get up to 6 attempts and honor `Retry-After`. The graph data the UI polls is cached for 60s, so the UI cannot exhaust the quota while a report is being generated.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Source Code Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Description | Check Installation |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Frontend runtime, includes npm | `node -v` |
| **Python** | ≥3.11, ≤3.12 | Backend runtime | `python --version` |
| **uv** | Latest | Python package manager | `uv --version` |

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and fill in the required API keys
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

```env
# LLM API Configuration (supports any LLM API with OpenAI SDK format)
# Recommended: Alibaba Qwen-plus model via Bailian Platform: https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/
# High consumption, try simulations with fewer than 40 rounds first
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
LLM_MODEL_NAME=qwen-plus

# Zep Cloud Configuration
# Free monthly quota is sufficient for simple usage: https://app.getzep.com/
ZEP_API_KEY=your_zep_api_key
```

**Optional Environment Variables (fork):**

```env
# Any OpenAI-compatible provider works for the LLM, for example:
#   Ollama Cloud: LLM_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/v1        LLM_MODEL_NAME=deepseek-v4.1-flash
#   OpenRouter:   LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 LLM_MODEL_NAME=qwen/qwen3.8-flash

# Jev decision step for agents (off by default)
JEV_ENABLED=true
TYPESAFE_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key   # an OpenRouter key; no separate TypeSafe account needed
TYPESAFE_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api
# JEV_MODEL=jev-1.13          # model name (default jev-1.13)
# JEV_SAMPLING=sample         # sample (default) or argmax
# JEV_CONCURRENCY=50          # parallel Jev requests
# JEV_SEED=42                 # set for reproducible sampling

# Max seconds to wait for Zep to process an uploaded graph (default 600)
ZEP_INGESTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=3600
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# One-click installation of all dependencies (root + frontend + backend)
npm run setup:all
```

Or install step by step:

```bash
# Install Node dependencies (root + frontend)
npm run setup

# Install Python dependencies (backend, auto-creates virtual environment)
npm run setup:backend
```

#### 3. Start Services

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend (run from project root)
npm run dev
```

**Service URLs:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5001`

**Start Individually:**

```bash
npm run backend   # Start backend only
npm run frontend  # Start frontend only
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure environment variables (same as source deployment)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Pull image and start
docker compose up -d
```

Reads `.env` from root directory by default, maps ports `3000 (frontend) / 5001 (backend)`

> Mirror address for faster pulling is provided as comments in `docker-compose.yml`, replace if needed.
